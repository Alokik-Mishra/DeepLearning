## Course Description
ECBM4040 is a 1 semester course covering deep learning theory and implementation from both basic libraries and tensorflow. The course covers the following topics:

* Machine Learning, representation learning, and neural nets
* Network architecure, backprop, and loss functions
* Optimization and regularization
* Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), feedforward networks, and fully-connected nets
* Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and image classification
* Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and LSTMs
* Autoencoders
* Generative adversarial networks (GANS)

## Tech/Frameworks
Most of the analysis is done using Jupyter Notebooks in python 3. Util files are .py. Most of the code uses basic libraries including numpy, and matplotlib.
Some of the models are made using the tensorflow API and displayed using tensorboard.
